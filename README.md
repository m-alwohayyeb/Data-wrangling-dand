# Data-wrangling-dand
## Introduction :
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
## What Software Do I Need?
The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip. Please revisit our Anaconda tutorial earlier in the Nanodegree program for package installation instructions.
- pandas
- NumPy
- requests
- tweepy
- json
## Project Details
Your tasks in this project are as follows:
- Data wrangling, which consists of:
    - Gathering data (downloadable file in the Resources tab in the left most panel of your classroom and linked in step 1 below).
    - Assessing data
    - Cleaning data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
- Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations
